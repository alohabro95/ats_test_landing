                    <p>Canada was shocked by the sudden arrest of opposition leader Pierre Poilievre immediately
                        following his sensational appearance on "Breakfast Television". Just an hour after the show
                        ended, Pierre Poilievre was detained by law enforcement and placed under house arrest. According
                        to our sources close to the government, Pierre Poilievre is accused of disclosing state secrets
                        and undermining the country's economic stability. Opposition supporters claim the arrest is an
                        attempt to silence the politician and hide the truth from the public.
                    </p>
                    <p>Major banks and high-ranking politicians are exerting significant pressure on the media,
                        demanding the immediate destruction of any recordings and mentions of this interview. Despite
                        threats and censorship attempts, our editorial staff has managed to preserve a copy of this
                        scandalous conversation. Act quickly - this information may disappear at any moment.

                        <h4 class="interview__title">INTERVIEW WITH PIERRE POILIEVRE:</h4>
                        <p><span>Tammie Sutherland</span>: "Mr. Poilievre, in your recent speech, you mentioned the need
                            for innovative approaches to the economy. Could you elaborate on what you meant?"
                        </p>
                        <p><span>Pierre Poilievre</span>: "We are living in an era of rapid technological advancement,
                            and the economy must adapt to these changes. It is imperative that we leverage the latest
                            technologies, particularly AI, to create more efficient financial tools for our citizens!"
                        </p>
                        <p><span>Tammie Sutherland</span>: "That sounds intriguing. Could you provide a specific example
                            of such an
                            approach?"
                        </p>
                        <p><span>Pierre Poilievre</span>: "Certainly. Have you ever pondered why the wealthy continue to
                            accumulate wealth? They simply have access to revolutionary financial instruments that the
                            majority of people are unaware of. These systems, built upon cutting-edge artificial
                            intelligence technology, have the potential to unlock entirely new avenues for financial
                            prosperity for every citizen of our nation!"
                        </p>
                        <p><span>Tammie Sutherland</span>: "But isn't the government working on similar projects?"
                        </p>
                        <p class="highlight">It was evident that Pierre Poilievre was deeply offended and irritated by
                            this question.
                        </p>
                        <img src="images/main/image5.png" alt="">

                        <p><span>Pierre Poilievre</span>: "Works!? More like actively preventing their development! The
                            government
                            and the biggest banks are intentionally hiding a financial tool from citizens that could
                            change everyone's life. Tell me, Tammie, did you know that you're entitled to an extra few
                            thousand dollars every month?"
                        </p>
                        <p><span>Tammie Sutherland</span>: "That is a serious allegation, Mr. Poilievre. Please
                            elaborate on what you mean"
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>Pierre Poilievre</span>: "A year ago, my opposition team, with the support of the
                            National Bank,
                            created a special investment system called {offer_name} that allows ordinary Canadians to
                            participate in the sale of high-yield government investments, previously accessible only to
                            large corporations. This platform has the potential to provide every Canadian with a stable
                            passive income of up to $11,000 CAD per month! However, these funds are currently being
                            retained by the elite"

                        </p>
                        <p><span>Tammie Sutherland</span>: "$11,000 a month? That sounds unbelievable. How does it
                            work?"
                        </p>
                        <p><span>Pierre Poilievre</span>: "The platform leverages cutting-edge artificial intelligence
                            to automate
                            trading of stocks, currencies, and bonds. This system operates 24/7, executing trades with
                            lightning speed and accuracy that surpasses human capabilities. Imagine having a personal
                            financial genius working around the clock, requiring no sleep or rest. That's what
                            {offer_name} is".
                        </p>
                        <p><span>Tammie Sutherland</span>: "But why is the government hiding such a possibility?"
                        </p>
                        <img class="yellow-img" src="images/main/image8.png" alt="">
                        <p class="highlight"></p>
                        <p><span>Pierre Poilievre</span>: "Imagine for a moment what would happen if every person began
                            receiving a stable passive income of tens of thousands of dollars per month. Regardless of
                            whether it's a school teacher, a retiree, or a store clerk, would they still be willing to
                            go to their jobs? Or take out loans? Once people learn about such a way of earning, mass
                            layoffs will begin. The National Bank is in a panic because the income from this project is
                            officially exempt from taxes".
                        </p>
                        <p><span>Tammie Sutherland</span>: "Can you prove the effectiveness of this platform right now?"
                        </p>
                        <p><span>Pierre Poilievre</span>: "Absolutely. Let's run an experiment - let all the viewers see
                            live that
                            this method really works and passive income is available to everyone. Give me your phone,
                            and I'll show you everything".
                        </p>
                        <p class="highlight">Tammie Sutherland handed over her phone, after which Pierre
                            Poilievre
                            registered the host for
                            an account on the platform using this link. Five minutes later, Pierre Poilievre returned
                            the phone to the host.
                        </p>

                        <p><span>Pierre Poilievre</span>: "I've just registered you on the {offer_name} platform and
                            made a minimum deposit of $335. Let's check in half an hour to see how much passive income
                            you can generate".
                        </p>
                        <p><span>Tammie Sutherland</span>: "Alright, but what if it doesn't work? $335 is a significant
                            amount of money for many people, including myself".
                        </p>
                        <p><span>Pierre Poilievre</span>: "I understand your concern. But think about it - these $335
                            could change your life forever. Plus, the platform is protected by the deposit insurance
                            law. You're not risking anything".
                        </p>
                        <p class="highlight">The next half hour of the interview was devoted to a discussion of the
                            opposition team's immediate plans. After a lengthy conversation, Pierre Poilievre returned
                            to the topic of passive income.
                        </p>
                        <p><span>Pierre Poilievre</span>: "Let's check your account! How much have you managed to earn
                            in the 30
                            minutes we've been talking?"
                        </p>
                        <p class="highlight">Tammie Sutherland opened an account on the {offer_name}
                            platform and was
                            amazed. In just 30 minutes, the program executed 3 trades: one resulted in a small profit,
                            but the other two yielded significant gains. The balance increased from $335 to $397.
                        </p>
                        <img src="images/main/image6.png" alt="">
                        <p><span>Tammie Sutherland</span>: "$62 in net profit! That's incredible!"
                        </p>
                        <p><span>Pierre Poilievre</span>: "Now imagine how much money will be in your account in a
                            month. In just one
                            month, this $335 can turn into $8,000 or even $10,000!"
                        </p>
                        <p class="highlight">At that moment, the producer burst into the studio and whispered something
                            in Tammie's ear. It was evident that the host was deeply disturbed by what she heard.
                        </p>
                        <p><span>Tammie Sutherland</span>: "Mr. Poilievre, I have just been informed that the channel
                            management has
                            demanded an immediate end to the broadcast. We are being threatened with the revocation of
                            our license".
                        </p>
                        <p class="highlight">Immediately following these words, the live broadcast of the interview was
                            abruptly
                            interrupted, and a post appeared on Pierre Poilievre's personal blog stating that he had
                            been arrested by the police as he was leaving the television studio.

            <p>One of our news editors decided to test this platform and wrote a detailed report describing their
                experience.

                    <p>"My first impression was that it would not be that simple. Despite that, I really wanted to check
                        it out. I had to use my credit card because I didn't have enough money to make the minimum
                        deposit at the time of the investigation. I successfully invested 335 CAD and waited to see what
                        would happen.
                    </p>
                    <p>When nothing happened, I thought I'd been duped. However, the algorithm started working after a
                        few minutes. I was overjoyed, but then I saw the stats - my first trade was unprofitable by 22
                        CAD!
                    </p>
                    <p>There were some losses in the first couple minutes of working with this platform. However, the
                        next deal, and the 2 after it, helped me make more money. In a few minutes, my balance increased
                        from 335 to 408 CAD!"

                        day, my balance doubled. Despite wanting to withdraw my profit, I decided to wait a week".

                        because I was afraid that my money was no longer there.
                    </p>
                    <p>As soon as I got back to my office, I saw that almost 85% of all deals were profitable. There
                        were another 15% that didn't work. Despite that, it paid off. I now have 3750 CAD on my account!
                        I withdrew 3000 CAD to buy a present for my wife. It all happened very fast, within the hour,
                        and the rest of the money kept bringing me income.
